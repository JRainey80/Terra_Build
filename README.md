This architecture consists of an "on prem" network(simulated with a VNet) 
which connects to a central hub VNet. There are two Spoke VNets that peer 
with the hub. This results in spokes that can run their own independent 
workloads isolated from each other but share resources with the hub, saving
money and enabling central managment of those resources. The plan will be to 
continue adding to this initial architecture and having some fun.
